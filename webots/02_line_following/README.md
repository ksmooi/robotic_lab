## Class Definition and Initialization

```python
class LineFollower:
    """
    LineFollower is an object-oriented representation of a line-following robot controller.
    
    This class initializes the robot's sensors and motors, implements the line-following logic,
    and calculates odometry information such as total distance traveled and total rotation.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initializes the LineFollower instance by setting up the robot, sensors, motors,
        and relevant constants.
        """
        # Create the Robot instance
        self.robot = Robot()
        
        # Get the time step of the current world
        self.timestep = int(self.robot.getBasicTimeStep())

        # Constants
        self.MAX_SPEED = 6.28  # Maximum speed in radians/second
        self.WHEEL_RADIUS = 0.0201  # meters
        self.WHEEL_DISTANCE = 0.052  # meters
        
        # Initialize ground sensors
        self.ground_sensors = self._initialize_ground_sensors()
        
        # Initialize motors

        # Move robot slightly forward to not detect the start line immediately
        self._move_forward_initial()
```

The `LineFollower` class is the core of the script, responsible for managing sensor inputs, motor outputs, and odometry calculations. Let's delve into each component of the initialization process.

### Constants

```python
# Constants
self.MAX_SPEED = 6.28  # Maximum speed in radians/second
self.WHEEL_RADIUS = 0.0201  # meters
self.WHEEL_DISTANCE = 0.052  # meters
```

- **`MAX_SPEED`**: Defines the maximum rotational speed of the robot's wheels in radians per second.
- **`WHEEL_RADIUS`**: The radius of the robot's wheels in meters, essential for calculating linear displacement from rotational speed.
- **`WHEEL_DISTANCE`**: The distance between the two wheels in meters, used in calculating the robot's rotation based on differential speeds.

### Ground Sensor Initialization

```python
def _initialize_ground_sensors(self):
    """
    Initializes the ground sensors used for line detection.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of initialized DistanceSensor devices.
    """
    sensors = []
    for i in range(3):
        sensor = self.robot.getDevice(f'gs{i}')
        sensor.enable(self.timestep)
        sensors.append(sensor)
    return sensors
```

- **Purpose**: Sets up three ground sensors (`gs0`, `gs1`, `gs2`) to detect the line's position relative to the robot.
- **Operation**: Retrieves each ground sensor device, enables it with the simulation timestep, and stores it in a list for later use.

### Motor Initialization

```python
def _initialize_motors(self):
    """
    Initializes the left and right wheel motors.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the left and right Motor devices.
    """
    left_motor = self.robot.getDevice('left wheel motor')
    right_motor = self.robot.getDevice('right wheel motor')
    left_motor.setPosition(float('inf'))
    right_motor.setPosition(float('inf'))
    return left_motor, right_motor
```

- **Purpose**: Configures the left and right wheel motors for velocity control.
- **Operation**:
    - Retrieves the left and right wheel motor devices.
    - Sets their positions to infinity (`float('inf')`) to enable velocity control instead of position control.
    - Returns the motor objects for further manipulation.

### Odometry Variables

```python
# Initialize odometry variables
self.total_distance = 0.0
self.total_rotation = 0.0  # in radians
```

- **`total_distance`**: Accumulates the total distance the robot has traveled.
- **`total_rotation`**: Accumulates the total rotation (in radians) the robot has undergone.

### Initial Movement

```python
# Move robot slightly forward to not detect the start line immediately
self._move_forward_initial()
```

- **Purpose**: Prevents the robot from immediately detecting the start line by moving it slightly forward.
- **Operation**: Calls the `_move_forward_initial` method to execute a brief forward movement.

## Ground Sensor Configuration

```python
def _initialize_ground_sensors(self):
    """
    Initializes the ground sensors used for line detection.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of initialized DistanceSensor devices.
    """
    sensors = []
    for i in range(3):
        sensor = self.robot.getDevice(f'gs{i}')
        sensor.enable(self.timestep)
        sensors.append(sensor)
    return sensors
```

- **Sensors**:
    - **`gs0`**: Typically the leftmost ground sensor.
    - **`gs1`**: The center ground sensor.
    - **`gs2`**: The rightmost ground sensor.
- **Functionality**: These sensors detect the contrast between the line and the floor, allowing the robot to determine its position relative to the line.

---

## Motor Configuration

```python
def _initialize_motors(self):
    """
    Initializes the left and right wheel motors.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the left and right Motor devices.
    """
    left_motor = self.robot.getDevice('left wheel motor')
    right_motor = self.robot.getDevice('right wheel motor')
    left_motor.setPosition(float('inf'))
    right_motor.setPosition(float('inf'))
    return left_motor, right_motor
```

- **Motor Control**:
    - **Velocity Control**: By setting the motor positions to infinity, the motors are configured to rotate indefinitely, allowing for continuous speed adjustments.
    - **Direct Speed Setting**: The script will directly set the velocity of each motor based on sensor inputs to navigate the line.

---

## Initial Movement Logic

```python
def _move_forward_initial(self):
    """
    Moves the robot forward for a short duration to avoid immediate detection of the start line.
    """
    self.left_motor.setVelocity(self.MAX_SPEED)
    self.right_motor.setVelocity(self.MAX_SPEED)
    self.robot.step(1000)  # Move for 1 second
```

- **Purpose**: Prevents the robot from registering the start line immediately upon initialization, ensuring that it begins line-following behavior after a short forward movement.
- **Operation**:
    - Sets both motors to `MAX_SPEED` to move the robot forward.
    - Advances the simulation by 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using `self.robot.step(1000)`, during which the robot moves forward.

---

## Main Control Loop

```python
def run(self):
    """
    Runs the main control loop for the line-following robot.
    Continuously reads sensor values, determines motor actions based on sensor input,
    updates odometry, and prints the robot's current state.
    """
    while self.robot.step(self.timestep) != -1:
        # Read ground sensors
        sensor_values = [sensor.getValue() for sensor in self.ground_sensors]
        
        # Line following logic
        left_sensor, center_sensor, right_sensor = sensor_values
        if left_sensor > 500 and center_sensor < 350 and right_sensor > 500:
            # On line, drive straight
            left_speed = self.MAX_SPEED
            right_speed = self.MAX_SPEED
        elif right_sensor < 550:
            # Line is on the right, turn right
            left_speed = 0.25 * self.MAX_SPEED
            right_speed = -0.1 * self.MAX_SPEED
        elif left_sensor < 550:
            # Line is on the left, turn left
            left_speed = -0.1 * self.MAX_SPEED
            right_speed = 0.25 * self.MAX_SPEED
        else:
            # Default case, search by turning
            left_speed = 0.15 * self.MAX_SPEED
            right_speed = -0.15 * self.MAX_SPEED
        
        # Set motor velocities
        self.left_motor.setVelocity(left_speed)
        self.right_motor.setVelocity(right_speed)
        
        # Calculate displacement for this timestep
        delta_x = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (left_speed + right_speed) / 2.0) * self.time_step_seconds
        
        # Calculate rotation for this timestep (positive is counterclockwise)
        delta_omega = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (right_speed - left_speed) / self.WHEEL_DISTANCE) * self.time_step_seconds
        
        # Update total distance and rotation
        self.total_distance += abs(delta_x)  # Use absolute value for total distance
        self.total_rotation += delta_omega
        
        # Print odometry information (convert rotation to degrees for readability)
        rotation_degrees = (self.total_rotation / math.pi) * 180.0
        print(f"Distance traveled: {self.total_distance:.3f} meters")
        print(f"Current rotation: {rotation_degrees:.1f} degrees")
```

The `run` method embodies the robot's primary operational loop, executing repeatedly at each simulation timestep. Let's dissect its components:

### Sensor Reading

```python
sensor_values = [sensor.getValue() for sensor in self.ground_sensors]
left_sensor, center_sensor, right_sensor = sensor_values
```

- **Operation**:
    - Reads the current values from all three ground sensors.
    - Unpacks the sensor values into `left_sensor`, `center_sensor`, and `right_sensor` for clarity.

### Line-Following Logic

```python
if left_sensor > 500 and center_sensor < 350 and right_sensor > 500:
    # On line, drive straight
    left_speed = self.MAX_SPEED
    right_speed = self.MAX_SPEED
elif right_sensor < 550:
    # Line is on the right, turn right
    left_speed = 0.25 * self.MAX_SPEED
    right_speed = -0.1 * self.MAX_SPEED
elif left_sensor < 550:
    # Line is on the left, turn left
    left_speed = -0.1 * self.MAX_SPEED
    right_speed = 0.25 * self.MAX_SPEED
else:
    # Default case, search by turning
    left_speed = 0.15 * self.MAX_SPEED
    right_speed = -0.15 * self.MAX_SPEED
```

- **Conditions**:
    - **On Line**: If both side sensors (`gs0` and `gs2`) detect high values (indicating no line) and the center sensor (`gs1`) detects a low value (indicating the line is directly beneath), the robot is on the line and should move straight.
    - **Line on the Right**: If the right sensor detects a low value (indicating the line is towards the right), the robot should turn right to realign.
    - **Line on the Left**: If the left sensor detects a low value (indicating the line is towards the left), the robot should turn left to realign.
    - **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the robot doesn't detect the line and should search for it by turning in place.

- **Motor Speed Adjustments**:
    - **Driving Straight**: Both motors are set to `MAX_SPEED` to move forward.
    - **Turning Right**: The left motor is set to a quarter of `MAX_SPEED` while the right motor moves in reverse at a tenth of `MAX_SPEED` to initiate a right turn.
    - **Turning Left**: The left motor moves in reverse at a tenth of `MAX_SPEED` while the right motor is set to a quarter of `MAX_SPEED` to initiate a left turn.
    - **Searching for Line**: Both motors are set to move in opposite directions at fifteen percent of `MAX_SPEED` to turn in place, scanning for the line.

### Motor Velocity Setting

```python
self.left_motor.setVelocity(left_speed)
self.right_motor.setVelocity(right_speed)
```

- **Operation**: Applies the calculated velocities to the left and right motors, adjusting the robot's movement based on sensor inputs.

### Odometry Calculations

```python
# Calculate displacement for this timestep
delta_x = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (left_speed + right_speed) / 2.0) * self.time_step_seconds

# Calculate rotation for this timestep (positive is counterclockwise)
delta_omega = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (right_speed - left_speed) / self.WHEEL_DISTANCE) * self.time_step_seconds

# Update total distance and rotation
self.total_distance += abs(delta_x)  # Use absolute value for total distance
self.total_rotation += delta_omega
```

- **Displacement (`delta_x`)**:
    - **Formula**: \( \Delta x = r \times \frac{(v_{left} + v_{right})}{2} \times \Delta t \)
    - **Explanation**: Calculates the linear displacement based on the average of the left and right wheel speeds, wheel radius, and timestep duration.
    - **Absolute Value**: Ensures that the distance is always accumulated positively, regardless of the direction.

- **Rotation (`delta_omega`)**:
    - **Formula**: \( \Delta \omega = r \times \frac{(v_{right} - v_{left})}{d} \times \Delta t \)
    - **Explanation**: Determines the robot's rotational change based on the difference in wheel speeds, wheel radius, wheel distance, and timestep duration.
    - **Sign Convention**: Positive values indicate counterclockwise rotation, while negative values indicate clockwise rotation.

- **Accumulation**:
    - **`total_distance`**: Adds the absolute displacement for the current timestep to the total distance traveled.
    - **`total_rotation`**: Adds the rotational change for the current timestep to the total rotation.

### Odometry Information Display

```python
# Print odometry information (convert rotation to degrees for readability)
rotation_degrees = (self.total_rotation / math.pi) * 180.0
print(f"Distance traveled: {self.total_distance:.3f} meters")
print(f"Current rotation: {rotation_degrees:.1f} degrees")
```

- **Rotation Conversion**: Converts the total rotation from radians to degrees for easier interpretation.
- **Output**:
    - **`Distance traveled`**: Displays the total distance the robot has moved in meters.
    - **`Current rotation`**: Shows the accumulated rotation in degrees, indicating how much the robot has turned.

---

## Odometry Calculations

Odometry provides estimates of the robot's position and orientation based on wheel rotations. In this script, odometry calculations help in understanding how far the robot has traveled and how much it has rotated, offering valuable feedback for navigation and debugging.

### Displacement (`delta_x`)

```python
delta_x = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (left_speed + right_speed) / 2.0) * self.time_step_seconds
```

- **Purpose**: Calculates the linear displacement of the robot during the current timestep.
- **Calculation**:
    - **Average Speed**: \((v_{left} + v_{right}) / 2\) gives the average speed of the robot.
    - **Wheel Radius**: Multiplying by `WHEEL_RADIUS` converts rotational speed to linear speed.
    - **Time Step**: Multiplying by `time_step_seconds` gives the distance traveled during the timestep.

### Rotation (`delta_omega`)

```python
delta_omega = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (right_speed - left_speed) / self.WHEEL_DISTANCE) * self.time_step_seconds
```

- **Purpose**: Determines the change in the robot's orientation during the current timestep.
- **Calculation**:
    - **Speed Difference**: \((v_{right} - v_{left})\) captures the differential in wheel speeds, causing rotation.
    - **Wheel Distance**: Dividing by `WHEEL_DISTANCE` normalizes the rotation based on the distance between wheels.
    - **Wheel Radius and Time Step**: As with displacement, these factors convert rotational speed to angular displacement over the timestep.

### Accumulation

```python
self.total_distance += abs(delta_x)  # Use absolute value for total distance
self.total_rotation += delta_omega
```

- **Total Distance**: Aggregates the absolute displacement to ensure distance is cumulatively positive.
- **Total Rotation**: Accumulates the rotational changes to track the overall orientation changes of the robot.

### Odometry Output

```python
rotation_degrees = (self.total_rotation / math.pi) * 180.0
print(f"Distance traveled: {self.total_distance:.3f} meters")
print(f"Current rotation: {rotation_degrees:.1f} degrees")
```

- **Rotation Conversion**: Converts radians to degrees for readability.
- **Display**: Prints the total distance traveled and the current rotation angle, providing real-time feedback on the robot's movement.

---

## Execution Entry Point

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    line_follower = LineFollower()
    line_follower.run()
```

- **Purpose**: Ensures that the `LineFollower` class is instantiated and the main control loop is initiated when the script is executed directly.
- **Operation**:
    - **Instantiation**: Creates an instance of the `LineFollower` class, triggering the initialization process.
    - **Run Method**: Calls the `run` method to start the main control loop, enabling the robot to begin line-following behavior.

---

## Conclusion

The `line_follower.py` script offers a clear and methodical approach to controlling a line-following robot. By leveraging ground sensors and motor control, the robot can effectively navigate along a predefined line, adjusting its path based on sensor inputs. Additionally, the inclusion of odometry calculations provides valuable insights into the robot's movement, aiding in navigation accuracy and system debugging.

### Key Takeaways

- **Modular Design**: The script's object-oriented structure promotes code organization, making it easier to manage and extend.
- **Sensor Integration**: Utilizing multiple ground sensors allows the robot to make informed decisions about its trajectory relative to the line.
- **Adaptive Motor Control**: Adjusting motor speeds based on sensor readings ensures responsive and precise line-following behavior.
- **Odometry**: Tracking distance and rotation offers quantitative data on the robot's movement, useful for navigation tasks and performance evaluation.
- **Initialization Strategy**: Moving the robot slightly forward at the start prevents immediate line detection, ensuring smoother commencement of line-following behavior.

This controller serves as a solid foundation for more complex robotic navigation systems. Future enhancements could include implementing PID control for smoother line tracking, integrating additional sensors for obstacle avoidance, or expanding odometry calculations for full 2D position tracking.
