---

## Odometry Calculations

Odometry involves estimating the robot's position and orientation based on wheel movements. This section explains how the script calculates displacement and rotation to estimate the robot's position and orientation.

### Displacement (`delta_s`)

```python
delta_s = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (phildot + phirdot) / 2.0) * self.time_step_seconds
```

- **Purpose**: Calculates the linear displacement of the robot during the current timestep.
- **Calculation**:
    - **Average Wheel Speed**: \((v_{left} + v_{right}) / 2\) gives the average rotational speed of the wheels.
    - **Wheel Radius**: Multiplying by `WHEEL_RADIUS` converts rotational speed to linear speed.
    - **Time Step**: Multiplying by `time_step_seconds` gives the distance traveled during the timestep.
- **Formula**: \(\Delta s = r \times \frac{(v_{left} + v_{right})}{2} \times \Delta t\)

### Rotation (`delta_omega`)

```python
delta_omega = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (phirdot - phildot) / self.WHEEL_DISTANCE) * self.time_step_seconds
```

- **Purpose**: Determines the change in the robot's orientation during the current timestep.
- **Calculation**:
    - **Speed Difference**: \((v_{right} - v_{left})\) captures the differential in wheel speeds, causing rotation.
    - **Wheel Distance**: Dividing by `WHEEL_DISTANCE` normalizes the rotation based on the distance between wheels.
    - **Wheel Radius and Time Step**: These factors convert rotational speed to angular displacement over the timestep.
- **Formula**: \(\Delta \omega = r \times \frac{(v_{right} - v_{left})}{d} \times \Delta t\)

### Position Update

```python
# Calculate position change in global coordinates (swapped x and y)
delta_x = delta_s * math.cos(self.total_rotation)  # Changed from delta_y
delta_y = -delta_s * math.sin(self.total_rotation)  # Changed from delta_x and added negative

# Update position
self.x_pos += delta_x  # Swapped from y_pos
self.y_pos += delta_y  # Swapped from x_pos
```

- **Purpose**: Updates the robot's position in the global coordinate system based on the calculated displacement and rotation.
- **Operation**:
    - **Delta Calculations**:
        - **`delta_x`**: Determines the change in the X-coordinate based on the current orientation.
        - **`delta_y`**: Determines the change in the Y-coordinate, with a negative sign to account for the coordinate system orientation.
    - **Position Update**: Adds the calculated deltas to the current position coordinates.

**Note**: The comments indicate that `delta_x` and `delta_y` have been swapped and adjusted. This adjustment ensures that the robot's movement is accurately represented in the global frame.

### Error Distance Calculation

```python
# Compute error distance from origin
error_distance = math.sqrt(self.x_pos**2 + self.y_pos**2)
return error_distance
```

- **Purpose**: Calculates the Euclidean distance from the robot's current position to the origin (0,0,0).
- **Operation**:
    - **Calculation**: Uses the Pythagorean theorem to determine the straight-line distance.
    - **Return**: Returns the `error_distance` to assess how far the robot is from its target.

**Functionality**: This error distance is crucial for determining whether the robot has reached its destination within an acceptable margin of error.

### Full Odometry Method

```python
def calculate_odometry(self, phildot, phirdot):
    """
    Calculates the robot's displacement and rotation based on wheel velocities.

    Args:
        phildot (float): Velocity of the left wheel.
        phirdot (float): Velocity of the right wheel.

    Returns:
        float: The error distance from the origin.
    """
    # Calculate displacement and rotation
    delta_s = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (phildot + phirdot) / 2.0) * self.time_step_seconds
    delta_omega = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (phirdot - phildot) / self.WHEEL_DISTANCE) * self.time_step_seconds

    # Update total rotation
    self.total_rotation += delta_omega

    # Calculate position change in global coordinates (swapped x and y)
    delta_x = delta_s * math.cos(self.total_rotation)  # Changed from delta_y
    delta_y = -delta_s * math.sin(self.total_rotation)  # Changed from delta_x and added negative

    # Update position
    self.x_pos += delta_x  # Swapped from y_pos
    self.y_pos += delta_y  # Swapped from x_pos

    # Update total distance
    self.total_distance += abs(delta_s)

    # Compute error distance from origin
    error_distance = math.sqrt(self.x_pos**2 + self.y_pos**2)
    return error_distance
```

**Functionality**: This method integrates all the steps discussed above to update the robot's odometry based on current wheel velocities, ultimately returning the error distance from the origin.

---

## Control Logic

```python
def control_logic(self, sensor_values):
    """
    Determines motor velocities based on ground sensor readings.

    Args:
        sensor_values (list): Current readings from ground sensors.

    Returns:
        tuple: Desired velocities for the left and right motors.
    """
    if sensor_values[0] > 500 and sensor_values[1] < 350 and sensor_values[2] > 500:
        # On line, drive straight
        return self.MAX_SPEED, self.MAX_SPEED
    elif sensor_values[2] < 550:
        # Line is on the right, turn right
        return 0.25 * self.MAX_SPEED, -0.1 * self.MAX_SPEED
    elif sensor_values[0] < 550:
        # Line is on the left, turn left
        return -0.1 * self.MAX_SPEED, 0.25 * self.MAX_SPEED
    else:
        # Default case, search by turning
        return 0.15 * self.MAX_SPEED, -0.15 * self.MAX_SPEED
```

- **Purpose**: Determines the appropriate motor velocities based on the current readings from the ground sensors.
- **Operation**:
    - **Conditions**:
        - **On Line**: If both side sensors (`gs0` and `gs2`) detect high values (indicating no line) and the center sensor (`gs1`) detects a low value (indicating the line is directly beneath), the robot is considered to be on the line and should move straight.
        - **Line on the Right**: If the right sensor (`gs2`) detects a low value, indicating the line is towards the right, the robot should turn right to realign.
        - **Line on the Left**: If the left sensor (`gs0`) detects a low value, indicating the line is towards the left, the robot should turn left to realign.
        - **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the robot doesn't detect the line and should search for it by turning in place.
    - **Motor Speed Adjustments**:
        - **Driving Straight**: Both motors are set to `MAX_SPEED` to move forward.
        - **Turning Right**: The left motor is set to a quarter of `MAX_SPEED` while the right motor moves in reverse at a tenth of `MAX_SPEED` to initiate a right turn.
        - **Turning Left**: The left motor moves in reverse at a tenth of `MAX_SPEED` while the right motor is set to a quarter of `MAX_SPEED` to initiate a left turn.
        - **Searching for Line**: Both motors are set to move in opposite directions at fifteen percent of `MAX_SPEED` to turn in place, scanning for the line.

**Functionality**: This control logic ensures that the robot adjusts its movement based on real-time sensor inputs, enabling it to follow the line accurately and make necessary corrections when deviations occur.

## Main Control Loop

```python
def run(self):
    """
    The main loop that runs the odometry counter. It reads sensor values,
    updates motor velocities, calculates odometry, and checks if the
    destination is reached.
    """
    while self.robot.step(self.timestep) != -1:
        # Get LiDAR range data and print the ranges (360 angles)
        ranges = self.lidar.getRangeImage()
        # print(f"Ranges: {len(ranges)}")            
        # print(f"Range at 0 degrees: {ranges[0]}")
        
        if self.VISUALIZE_OPTION == 1 or self.VISUALIZE_OPTION == 2:

        # Convert rotation to degrees for readability

```

The `run` method serves as the heart of the `RangeFinder` class, executing continuously to manage the robot's navigation, sensor data processing, odometry calculations, and LIDAR data visualization.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Simulation Step**:
    - `self.robot.step(self.timestep)`: Advances the simulation by one time step. The loop continues as long as this method does not return `-1`, indicating the simulation is still running.

2. **LIDAR Data Retrieval**:
    - `ranges = self.lidar.getRangeImage()`: Fetches the latest range data from the LIDAR sensor. This data consists of distance measurements at various angles around the robot.

3. **LIDAR Data Visualization**:
    - **Visualization Options**:
        - **Option 1 or 2**: Processes and visualizes LIDAR data in either the robot or world frame.
            - **Processing**: Calls `process_lidar_data` to convert raw LIDAR ranges into Cartesian coordinates.
            - **Visualization**:
                - **Option 1**: Visualizes data in the robot's frame.
                - **Option 2**: Visualizes data in the world frame.
        - **Option 3**: Transforms and visualizes LIDAR data using the `transform_and_visualize_lidar` method, plotting in the world frame with transformations applied.
    - **Functionality**: Depending on the `VISUALIZE_OPTION`, the robot can visualize its environment from different perspectives, enhancing situational awareness.

4. **Ground Sensor Reading**:
    - `sensor_values = self.read_ground_sensors()`: Retrieves the latest readings from the ground sensors to determine the robot's position relative to the line.

5. **Motor Velocity Determination**:
    - `phildot, phirdot = self.control_logic(sensor_values)`: Determines the desired velocities for the left and right motors based on sensor inputs.
    - `self.set_motor_velocity(phildot, phirdot)`: Applies the calculated velocities to the motors, adjusting the robot's movement accordingly.

6. **Odometry Update**:
    - `error_distance = self.calculate_odometry(phildot, phirdot)`: Updates the robot's position and orientation based on current wheel velocities and calculates the error distance from the origin.

7. **Rotation Conversion**:
    - `rotation_degrees = (self.total_rotation / math.pi) * 180.0`: Converts the total rotation from radians to degrees for easier interpretation.

8. **Odometry Information Display**:
    - **Condition**: Checks if the `total_distance` exceeds the `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` by more than 0.3 meters to reduce verbosity during initial movement.
    - **Output**: Prints the robot's current position, total distance traveled, current rotation in degrees, and the error distance from the origin.

9. **Destination Check**:
    - **Condition**: Determines whether the robot has reached its intended destination by checking if:
        - **Distance Threshold**: `self.total_distance` exceeds `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD`.
        - **Error Threshold**: `error_distance` is within `ERROR_THRESHOLD`.
    - **Action Upon Reaching Destination**:
        - **Motor Stopping**: Sets both motors' velocities to zero, halting the robot.
        - **Feedback**: Prints a confirmation message along with final odometry data.
        - **Loop Termination**: Breaks out of the main control loop, effectively ending the script.

**Functionality**: This main loop ensures that the robot continuously processes sensor data, adjusts its movement, updates its odometry, visualizes its environment, and determines when it has successfully reached its target destination.

## Execution Entry Point

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    odometry_counter = RangeFinder()
    odometry_counter.run()
```

- **Purpose**: Ensures that the `RangeFinder` class is instantiated and the main control loop is initiated when the script is executed directly.
- **Operation**:
    - **Instantiation**: Creates an instance of the `RangeFinder` class, triggering the initialization process.
    - **Run Method**: Calls the `run` method to start the main control loop, enabling the robot to begin navigation, odometry tracking, and LIDAR data visualization.

**Functionality**: This block allows the script to be executed as a standalone program, initiating all necessary components for autonomous navigation and environmental perception.
