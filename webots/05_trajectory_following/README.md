## Class Definition and Constants

```python
class TrajectoryFollower:
    """
    A controller class for a differential drive robot that follows a predefined trajectory.
    
    This class implements a waypoint-following behavior using GPS and compass sensors
    for localization. It uses a simple proportional controller to adjust wheel speeds
    based on distance and heading errors to the current target waypoint.
    
    Attributes:

## Initialization

The `__init__` method sets up the robot's hardware components, initializes sensors and motors, and prepares variables for odometry and position tracking.

### Robot and Time Step Initialization

```python
def __init__(self):
    """
    Initialize the robot controller with necessary sensors and actuators.
    
    Sets up the robot supervisor, motors, GPS, compass, and initializes the waypoint
    trajectory that the robot will follow.
    """
    # Initialize the Robot instance and timestep
    self.robot = Supervisor()
    self.timestep = int(self.robot.getBasicTimeStep())
    self.time_step_seconds = self.timestep / 1000.0  # Convert to seconds
```

- **Robot Instance**: Creates an instance of the `Supervisor` class, which extends the `Robot` class with additional capabilities for higher-level control over the simulation.
  
- **Time Step**: Retrieves the simulation's basic time step (`self.robot.getBasicTimeStep()`), converting it from milliseconds to seconds for use in subsequent calculations.

### Sensor and Motor Initialization

```python
    # Initialize sensors and motors
    self.ground_sensors = self.initialize_ground_sensors(3)
    self.left_motor, self.right_motor = self.initialize_motors()
```

- **Ground Sensors**: Initializes three ground sensors (`gs0`, `gs1`, `gs2`) used for line detection. These sensors help the robot determine its position relative to a line, enabling it to follow the trajectory accurately.
  
- **Motors**: Initializes the left and right wheel motors, configuring them for velocity control.

### Odometry and Position Variables

```python
    # Initialize odometry variables
    self.total_distance = 0.0
    self.total_rotation = 0.0  # in radians

    # Initialize position variables
    self.x_pos = 0.0
    self.y_pos = 0.0
    self.z_pos = 0.0  # Will remain 0 for 2D movement
```

- **Odometry Variables**:
    - **`total_distance`**: Accumulates the total distance the robot has traveled.
    - **`total_rotation`**: Accumulates the total rotation (in radians) the robot has undergone.
  
- **Position Variables**:
    - **`x_pos` & `y_pos`**: Track the robot's position in a 2D plane.
    - **`z_pos`**: Remains zero as the robot operates in a 2D environment.

### LIDAR Initialization

```python
    # Add LIDAR initialization
    self.lidar = self.robot.getDevice('LDS-01')
    self.lidar.enable(self.timestep)
    self.lidar.enablePointCloud()
```

- **LIDAR Device**: Retrieves the LIDAR sensor (`LDS-01`) from the robot's hardware.
  
- **Enabling LIDAR**: Activates the LIDAR sensor with the simulation's time step.
  
- **Point Cloud**: Enables the generation of point cloud data, which is essential for spatial mapping and visualization.

### Display Initialization

```python
    # Add display initialization
    self.display = self.robot.getDevice('display')
```

- **Display Device**: Retrieves the display device from the robot's hardware, potentially used for rendering visual feedback or sensor data.

### Target Position Initialization

```python
    # Add target position
    self.target_x = 0.0277
    self.target_y = -1.57
```

- **Target Coordinates**: Defines the desired destination coordinates in the robot's environment. The robot aims to navigate towards this point.

### Angle Array Initialization

```python
    # Create a list of angles from 0 to 360 degrees
    self.angles = np.linspace(3.14159, -3.14159, 360)
```

- **`self.angles`**: Generates an array of angles ranging from π to -π radians (equivalent to 180° to -180°), divided into 360 points. This array is used to map LIDAR readings to specific angles around the robot.

### Initial Movement

```python
    # Start moving forward slightly to avoid immediate start line detection
    self.set_motor_velocity(self.MAX_SPEED, self.MAX_SPEED)
    self.robot.step(1000)  # Move for 1 second
```

- **Purpose**: Prevents the robot from immediately detecting the start line by moving it slightly forward.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Motor Control**: Sets both motors to `MAX_SPEED` to move the robot forward.
    - **Simulation Step**: Advances the simulation by 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using `self.robot.step(1000)`, during which the robot moves forward.

**Note**: The use of `self.robot.step(1000)` is atypical, as `step()` usually takes the time step duration rather than a fixed duration. It might be intended to simulate the robot moving forward for a fixed duration, but in practice, this approach could be refined for better control.

---

## Motor Velocity Control

```python
def set_motor_velocity(self, left_velocity, right_velocity):
    """
    Set the velocities for both wheel motors.
    
    Args:
        left_velocity (float): Desired velocity for left wheel in rad/s
        right_velocity (float): Desired velocity for right wheel in rad/s
        
    Note:
        Velocities are automatically clamped to MAX_SPEED in calculate_wheel_speeds
    """
    self.left_motor.setVelocity(left_velocity)
    self.right_motor.setVelocity(right_velocity)
```

- **Purpose**: Provides a convenient method to set the velocities of both motors simultaneously.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Motor Control**: Applies the specified velocities to the left and right motors, controlling the robot's movement.

**Note**: The method assumes that the velocities passed to it are already clamped within the acceptable range (e.g., not exceeding `MAX_SPEED`). This clamping is handled in the `calculate_wheel_speeds` method to ensure motor commands remain within safe operational limits.

---

## Sensor Reading

```python
def read_ground_sensors(self):
    """
    Reads the current values from all ground sensors.

    Returns:
        list: A list of sensor values.
    """
    return [sensor.getValue() for sensor in self.ground_sensors]
```

- **Purpose**: Fetches the latest readings from all ground sensors.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Sensor Value Retrieval**: Iterates through each ground sensor and retrieves its current value using the `getValue()` method.
    - **Return**: Returns the sensor values as a list for further processing.

**Functionality**: These sensor values are critical for determining the robot's position relative to the line, enabling it to make informed decisions about movement adjustments to follow the trajectory accurately.

---

## Odometry Calculations

Odometry involves estimating the robot's position and orientation based on wheel movements. This section explains how the script calculates displacement and rotation to estimate the robot's position and orientation.

### Displacement (`delta_s`)

```python
def calculate_odometry(self, phildot, phirdot):
    """
    Calculates the robot's displacement and rotation based on wheel velocities.

    Args:
        phildot (float): Velocity of the left wheel.
        phirdot (float): Velocity of the right wheel.

    Returns:
        float: The error distance from the origin.
    """
    # Calculate displacement and rotation
    delta_s = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (phildot + phirdot) / 2.0) * self.time_step_seconds
    delta_omega = (self.WHEEL_RADIUS * (phirdot - phildot) / self.WHEEL_DISTANCE) * self.time_step_seconds
```

- **Purpose**: Calculates the linear displacement (`delta_s`) of the robot and its change in orientation (`delta_omega`) during the current timestep.
  
- **Calculation**:
    - **Average Wheel Speed**: \((v_{left} + v_{right}) / 2\) gives the average rotational speed of the wheels.
    - **Wheel Radius**: Multiplying by `WHEEL_RADIUS` converts rotational speed to linear speed.
    - **Time Step**: Multiplying by `time_step_seconds` gives the distance traveled during the timestep.

- **Formula**:
    - **Displacement**: \(\Delta s = r \times \frac{(v_{left} + v_{right})}{2} \times \Delta t\)
    - **Rotation**: \(\Delta \omega = r \times \frac{(v_{right} - v_{left})}{d} \times \Delta t\)
  
### Rotation (`delta_omega`)

- **Purpose**: Determines the change in the robot's orientation during the current timestep.
  
- **Calculation**:
    - **Speed Difference**: \((v_{right} - v_{left})\) captures the differential in wheel speeds, causing rotation.
    - **Wheel Distance**: Dividing by `WHEEL_DISTANCE` normalizes the rotation based on the distance between wheels.
    - **Wheel Radius and Time Step**: These factors convert rotational speed to angular displacement over the timestep.

### Position Update

```python
    # Update total rotation
    self.total_rotation += delta_omega

    # Calculate position change in global coordinates (swapped x and y)
    delta_x = delta_s * math.cos(self.total_rotation)  # Changed from delta_y
    delta_y = -delta_s * math.sin(self.total_rotation)  # Changed from delta_x and added negative

    # Update position
    self.x_pos += delta_x  # Swapped from y_pos
    self.y_pos += delta_y  # Swapped from x_pos
```

- **Purpose**: Updates the robot's position in the global coordinate system based on the calculated displacement and rotation.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Total Rotation**: Accumulates the rotation over time by adding `delta_omega` to `self.total_rotation`.
    - **Delta Calculations**:
        - **`delta_x`**: Determines the change in the X-coordinate based on the current orientation (`self.total_rotation`).
        - **`delta_y`**: Determines the change in the Y-coordinate, with a negative sign to account for the coordinate system orientation.
    - **Position Update**: Adds the calculated deltas to the current position coordinates.

**Note**: The comments indicate that `delta_x` and `delta_y` have been swapped and adjusted. This adjustment ensures that the robot's movement is accurately represented in the global frame.

### Error Distance Calculation

```python
    # Update total distance
    self.total_distance += abs(delta_s)

    # Compute error distance from origin
    error_distance = math.sqrt(self.x_pos**2 + self.y_pos**2)
    return error_distance
```

- **Purpose**: Calculates the Euclidean distance from the robot's current position to the origin (0,0,0).
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Total Distance**: Accumulates the absolute displacement to ensure distance is always positive, regardless of direction.
    - **Error Distance**: Uses the Pythagorean theorem to determine the straight-line distance from the origin.
    - **Return**: Returns the `error_distance` to assess how far the robot is from its target.

**Functionality**: This error distance is crucial for determining whether the robot has reached its destination within an acceptable margin of error.

## Control Logic

```python
def control_logic(self, sensor_values):
    """
    Determines motor velocities based on ground sensor readings.

    Args:
        sensor_values (list): Current readings from ground sensors.

    Returns:
        tuple: Desired velocities for the left and right motors.
    """
    if sensor_values[0] > 500 and sensor_values[1] < 350 and sensor_values[2] > 500:
        # On line, drive straight
        return self.MAX_SPEED, self.MAX_SPEED
    elif sensor_values[2] < 550:
        # Line is on the right, turn right
        return 0.25 * self.MAX_SPEED, -0.1 * self.MAX_SPEED
    elif sensor_values[0] < 550:
        # Line is on the left, turn left
        return -0.1 * self.MAX_SPEED, 0.25 * self.MAX_SPEED
    else:
        # Default case, search by turning
        return 0.15 * self.MAX_SPEED, -0.15 * self.MAX_SPEED
```

- **Purpose**: Determines the appropriate motor velocities based on the current readings from the ground sensors.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Conditions**:
        - **On Line**: If both side sensors (`gs0` and `gs2`) detect high values (indicating no line) and the center sensor (`gs1`) detects a low value (indicating the line is directly beneath), the robot is considered to be on the line and should move straight.
        - **Line on the Right**: If the right sensor (`gs2`) detects a low value, indicating the line is towards the right, the robot should turn right to realign.
        - **Line on the Left**: If the left sensor (`gs0`) detects a low value, indicating the line is towards the left, the robot should turn left to realign.
        - **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the robot doesn't detect the line and should search for it by turning in place.
    - **Motor Speed Adjustments**:
        - **Driving Straight**: Both motors are set to `MAX_SPEED` to move forward.
        - **Turning Right**: The left motor is set to a quarter of `MAX_SPEED` while the right motor moves in reverse at a tenth of `MAX_SPEED` to initiate a right turn.
        - **Turning Left**: The left motor moves in reverse at a tenth of `MAX_SPEED` while the right motor is set to a quarter of `MAX_SPEED` to initiate a left turn.
        - **Searching for Line**: Both motors are set to move in opposite directions at fifteen percent of `MAX_SPEED` to turn in place, scanning for the line.

**Functionality**: This control logic ensures that the robot adjusts its movement based on real-time sensor inputs, enabling it to follow the trajectory accurately and make necessary corrections when deviations occur.

        self.set_motor_velocity(left_speed, right_speed)
        
        # Check if waypoint reached and update index
        if rho < 0.15:
            self.index = 0 if self.index >= len(self.WP) - 1 else self.index + 1
            # print(f"Stepped to index: {self.index}")
```

The `run` method embodies the robot's primary operational loop, executing repeatedly at each simulation timestep. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. **Simulation Step**:
    - `self.robot.step(self.timestep)`: Advances the simulation by one time step. The loop continues as long as this method does not return `-1`, indicating the simulation is still running.

2. **Robot Pose Retrieval**:
    - `x, y, theta = self.get_robot_pose()`: Retrieves the robot's current position (`x`, `y`) and orientation (`theta`) using GPS and compass sensors.
  
3. **Marker Position Update**:
    - `self.marker.setSFVec3f([*self.WP[self.index], 0])`: Updates the position of a visual marker in the simulation to indicate the current target waypoint.

4. **Control Errors Calculation**:
    - `rho, alpha = self.calculate_control_errors(x, y, theta)`: Calculates the distance (`rho`) and heading (`alpha`) errors relative to the current target waypoint.

5. **Wheel Speeds Calculation and Setting**:
    - `left_speed, right_speed = self.calculate_wheel_speeds(rho, alpha)`: Determines the desired wheel velocities based on the calculated errors using a proportional controller.
    - `self.set_motor_velocity(left_speed, right_speed)`: Applies the calculated velocities to the motors, adjusting the robot's movement accordingly.

6. **Waypoint Reached Check and Update**:
    - `if rho < 0.15`: Checks if the robot is within a threshold distance (`0.15` meters) of the current waypoint.
    - `self.index = 0 if self.index >= len(self.WP) - 1 else self.index + 1`: Updates the target waypoint index, cycling back to the first waypoint if the end of the list is reached.

**Functionality**: This loop ensures that the robot continuously processes sensor data, adjusts its movement, updates its odometry, visualizes its environment, and determines when it has successfully reached its target waypoint.

**Note**: The visualization options and LIDAR data processing methods are not invoked within this loop, indicating that they might be part of a different or extended implementation.
