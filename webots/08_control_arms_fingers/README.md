## Initialization

The `__init__` method sets up the robot's hardware components, initializes sensors and motors, prepares mapping structures, and defines the trajectory waypoints. This comprehensive initialization ensures that the robot is ready for autonomous operation.

### Robot and Time Step Initialization

```python
def __init__(self):
    """
    Initializes the TiagoController by setting up the robot, initializing
    devices (motors, sensors, etc.), and preparing mapping and trajectory
    data structures.
    """
    # Initialize robot
    self.robot = Supervisor()
    self.timestep = int(self.robot.getBasicTimeStep())
            
    # Movement constants
    self.MAX_SPEED = 6.28
    self.KP = 1.0
    self.KA = 5.0
    self.WHEEL_RADIUS = 0.10
    self.AXLE_LENGTH = 0.455
```

- **Robot Instance**: Creates an instance of the `Supervisor` class, enabling higher-level control over the simulation environment.
  
- **Time Step**: Retrieves the simulation's basic time step (`self.robot.getBasicTimeStep()`), converting it to an integer for use in control loops and sensor updates.
  
- **Movement Constants**: Initializes constants related to movement, including maximum speed, proportional gains (`KP`, `KA`), wheel radius, and axle length, which are essential for motion and control calculations.

### Motor and Sensor Initialization

```python
    # Arm joint positions dictionary
    self.robot_init_joints = {
        'torso_lift_joint': 0.35,            # lower back, along z-axis
        'arm_1_joint': 0.71,                 # shoulder, along z-axis (min: 0.07 rad)
        'arm_2_joint': 1.02,                 # shoulder, along x-axis (max: 1.02 rad)
        'arm_3_joint': -2.815,               # shoulder, along y-axis
        'arm_4_joint': 1.011,                # elbow, along x-axis
        'arm_5_joint': 0,                    # elbow, along z-axis
        'arm_6_joint': 0,                    # wrist, along y-axis
        'arm_7_joint': 0,                    # wrist, along x-axis
        'gripper_left_finger_joint': 0,      # left finger
        'gripper_right_finger_joint': 0,     # right finger
        'head_1_joint': 0,                   # head left-right, along axis-z
        'head_2_joint': 0                    # head up-down, along axis-y
    }
                    
    self.MAX_GRIP_FORCE = 10.0  # Maximum allowed gripping force
    
    # Initialize devices
    self.init_devices()
```

- **Arm Joint Positions**: Defines a dictionary (`robot_init_joints`) specifying the initial positions for various joints of the robot's arm and other movable parts. This setup is crucial for ensuring the manipulator starts from a known, safe position.
  
- **Maximum Gripper Force**: Sets `MAX_GRIP_FORCE` to `10.0`, preventing the gripper from exerting excessive force that could damage objects or the robot itself.
  
- **Device Initialization**: Calls the `init_devices()` method to initialize and configure all necessary devices, including motors and sensors.

### Display and Mapping Structures Initialization

```python
    # Initialize mapping structures
    self.map = np.zeros((250, 300))
    self.trajectory_map = np.zeros((250, 300))
    self.kernel = np.ones((20, 20))
    self.angles = np.linspace(2.094395, -2.094395, 667)
```

- **Occupancy Map (`self.map`)**: Initializes a 2D NumPy array of zeros with dimensions `250x300` pixels, representing the robot's environment. Each cell will be updated based on LIDAR data to indicate the presence or absence of obstacles.
  
- **Trajectory Map (`self.trajectory_map`)**: Another 2D NumPy array of zeros with the same dimensions, used to track and visualize the robot's movement path.
  
- **Convolution Kernel (`self.kernel`)**: Creates a `20x20` matrix of ones, used later for convolution operations to process the occupancy map, enhancing obstacle detection accuracy.
  
- **LIDAR Angles (`self.angles`)**: Generates an array of `667` angles ranging from approximately +120 degrees (`2.094395` radians) to -120 degrees (`-2.094395` radians). These angles correspond to the directional measurements taken by the LIDAR sensor, mapping each range reading to a specific angle relative to the robot's heading.

### Waypoints and Angle Array Initialization

```python
    # Define waypoints as a list of (x, y) tuples
    self.WP = [
        (+0.641, -2.460), (+0.224, -3.072), (-0.690, -3.074), (-1.690, -2.841), (-1.703, -2.302),  #  0 -  4

        (+0.733, -0.093), (+0.701, -0.600), (+0.732, -0.094), (+0.684, +0.152), (+0.100, +0.501),  # 10 - 14
        (-0.682, +0.502), (-1.542, +0.424), (-1.762, -0.323), (-1.690, -1.242), (-1.803, -2.303),  # 15 - 19
        (-1.683, -2.842), (-0.693, -3.072), (+0.223, -3.073), (+0.223, -3.072), (+0.643, -2.463),  # 20 - 24
        (+0.632, -2.132), (+0.552, -2.213), (+0.714, -0.791), (+0.714, -0.792), (+0.711, +0.413)   # 25 - 29
    ]
    self.index = 0  # Current waypoint index
    self.robot_stop = False  # Flag to indicate if the robot should stop
```

- **Waypoints (`self.WP`)**: A predefined list of `(x, y)` tuples representing the sequence of waypoints the robot should navigate through. These waypoints define the trajectory, ensuring the robot follows a specific path within its environment.
  
- **Waypoint Index (`self.index`)**: Tracks the current target waypoint in the list. Initialized to `0`, pointing to the first waypoint.
  
- **Robot Stop Flag (`self.robot_stop`)**: A boolean flag indicating whether the robot should halt its movement. Initially set to `False`.

    for joint_name in self.robot_init_joints.keys():
        try:
            if 'gripper' in joint_name:
                # Special case for gripper sensors
                sensor_name = joint_name.replace('gripper_', 'gripper_').replace('finger_joint', 'sensor_finger_joint')
            else:
                sensor_name = joint_name + '_sensor'
            
            encoder = self.robot.getDevice(sensor_name)
            if encoder is not None:
                encoder.enable(self.timestep)
                self.encoders[joint_name] = encoder
            else:
                print(f"Warning: Encoder '{sensor_name}' not found")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error initializing {joint_name}: {e}")

    # Enable force feedback for gripper joints
    self.motor_handles['gripper_left_finger_joint'].enableForceFeedback(self.timestep)
    self.motor_handles['gripper_right_finger_joint'].enableForceFeedback(self.timestep)
```

- **Encoders Initialization**:
    - **Encoders Dictionary**: Initializes an empty dictionary (`self.encoders`) to store handles to encoder devices.
    - **Encoder Retrieval**: Iterates through each joint in `robot_init_joints`, attempting to retrieve and enable corresponding encoder devices. Handles special cases for gripper joints by adjusting sensor names.
    - **Error Handling**: Prints warnings if encoders are not found and errors if initialization fails.
  
- **Force Feedback for Grippers**:
    - **Enabling Force Feedback**: Activates force feedback on the gripper joints (`'gripper_left_finger_joint'` and `'gripper_right_finger_joint'`), allowing the robot to sense and respond to forces exerted by the gripper.

### Setting Motor Velocities

```python
def set_motor_velocity(self, left_velocity, right_velocity):
    """
    Set the velocities for both wheel motors.
    
    Args:
        left_velocity (float): Desired velocity for left wheel in rad/s
        right_velocity (float): Desired velocity for right wheel in rad/s
        
    Note:
        Velocities are automatically clamped to MAX_SPEED in calculate_motor_speeds
    """
    self.left_motor.setVelocity(left_velocity)
    self.right_motor.setVelocity(right_velocity)
```

- **Purpose**: Provides a method to set the velocities of both wheel motors simultaneously, facilitating synchronized movement.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Motor Velocity Control**: Applies the specified `left_velocity` and `right_velocity` to the left and right motors, respectively, dictating the robot's movement direction and speed.

---

## Sensor Reading Methods

Accurate sensor data is crucial for effective navigation and manipulation. The `TiagoController` class initializes and retrieves data from various sensors to maintain situational awareness and control precision.

### Initializing Sensors

Already covered in the `init_devices()` method, where GPS, compass, and LIDAR sensors are initialized and enabled.

### Retrieving Robot Pose

```python

    Returns:
        tuple: (x, y, theta) where:
            x (float): X-coordinate in world frame
            y (float): Y-coordinate in world frame
            theta (float): Heading angle in radians [-Ï€, Ï€]
    """
    x = self.gps.getValues()[0]
    y = self.gps.getValues()[1]
    theta = np.arctan2(self.compass.getValues()[0], self.compass.getValues()[1])
    return x, y, theta
```

- **Operation**:
    - **Position Retrieval**: Uses the GPS sensor to obtain the X and Y coordinates of the robot in the world frame.
    - **Orientation Calculation**: Utilizes the compass sensor to determine the robot's heading angle (`theta`). The `np.arctan2` function calculates the angle between the positive X-axis and the vector defined by the compass readings, normalizing it within `[-Ï€, Ï€]` radians.
  
- **Return**: Provides a tuple `(x, y, theta)` representing the robot's current position and orientation.

---

## Odometry and Positioning

Odometry involves estimating the robot's position and orientation based on sensor data, particularly wheel encoders and inertial measurements. In this script, odometry calculations are integrated with sensor readings to maintain an accurate estimate of the robot's pose.

### World to Map Coordinate Transformation

    px = max(min(px, 249), 0)
    py = max(min(py, 299), 0)
    return [px, py]
```

- **Purpose**: Transforms the robot's real-world coordinates into corresponding grid positions on the occupancy map.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Scaling and Translation**:
        - **X-axis (`px`)**: Scales the world X-coordinate by `52` and translates it by `124.8` to fit the map's pixel dimensions.
        - **Y-axis (`py`)**: Scales the world Y-coordinate by `-52` (inverting the axis) and translates it by `93.834` to align with the map's pixel dimensions.
    - **Clamping**: Ensures that the resulting map coordinates do not exceed the boundaries of the occupancy grid (`250x300` pixels), preventing indexing errors.
    
- **Return**: Provides a list `[px, py]` representing the corresponding grid coordinates on the occupancy map.

**Note**: The scaling factors and translations (`52`, `124.8`, `-52`, `93.834`) are calibrated based on the simulation environment's scale and origin, ensuring accurate mapping from world coordinates to grid positions.

### Calculating Control Errors

    """
    # Distance to waypoint
    rho = np.sqrt((x - self.WP[self.index][0])**2 + (y - self.WP[self.index][1])**2)
    
    # Desired heading angle
    absolute_error = np.arctan2(self.WP[self.index][1] - y, self.WP[self.index][0] - x)
    
    # Heading error
    alpha = absolute_error - theta
    
    # Normalize alpha to [-pi, pi]
    if alpha > np.pi:
        alpha = alpha - 2 * np.pi
    elif alpha < -np.pi:
        alpha = alpha + 2 * np.pi
        
    return rho, alpha
```

- **Purpose**: Determines how far the robot is from its current target waypoint (`rho`) and the difference in orientation (`alpha`) it needs to correct to face the waypoint directly.
  
- **Operation**:

    return leftSpeed, rightSpeed
```

- **Purpose**: Determines the appropriate velocities for the left and right motors to correct the robot's heading and reduce its distance to the target waypoint.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Proportional Control Factors**:
        - **`p1`**: Proportional gain for heading correction.
        - **`p2`**: Proportional gain for distance correction.
    - **Significant Turn Handling**:
        - If the absolute heading error (`abs(alpha)`) exceeds Ï€/4 radians (~45 degrees), indicating a significant turn is required, the motor speeds are adjusted with reduced influence from distance correction to enhance turning accuracy.
        - **Motor Speed Calculations**:
            - **For Significant Turns**:
                - **Left Motor**: `-alpha * p1 / 2 + rho * p2 / 8`
                - **Right Motor**: `alpha * p1 / 2 + rho * p2 / 8`
            - **For Regular Movement**:
                - **Left Motor**: `-alpha * p1 + rho * p2`
                - **Right Motor**: `alpha * p1 + rho * p2`
    - **Clamping**:
        - Ensures that neither motor speed exceeds `MAX_SPEED` in either direction, preventing mechanical strain and ensuring safe operation.
  
- **Return**: Provides a tuple `(leftSpeed, rightSpeed)` representing the calculated velocities for the left and right motors, respectively.

**Functionality**: This method implements a simple proportional controller that adjusts motor speeds based on real-time sensor data to steer the robot towards its target waypoint efficiently.

## Waypoint Management

Managing waypoints is crucial for guiding the robot along the desired trajectory. The `TiagoController` class provides methods to update the current waypoint and handle the robot's stop condition upon reaching the final waypoint.

### Updating Waypoints

```python
def update_waypoints(self, rho):
    """
    Updates the current waypoint index if the robot is within a certain distance (rho)
    of the target waypoint. If all waypoints are reached, it stops the robot and processes
    the final occupancy map.

    Args:
        rho (float): Current distance error to the target waypoint.
    """
    if rho < 0.5:
        if self.index >= len(self.WP) - 1:  # Check if the last waypoint is reached
            print(" = Final waypoint reached")
            self.stop_robot()
            self.show_convolved_map()
            return

        self.index += 1
        print(f" > Waypoint index: {self.index}, position: {self.WP[self.index]}")

        if self.index >= len(self.WP):
            print(f" = Waypoint reached, index: {self.index}")
            self.stop_robot()
            self.show_convolved_map()
```

- **Purpose**: Advances the robot to the next waypoint once it is sufficiently close (`rho < 0.5` meters) to the current target. If all waypoints are completed, it stops the robot and processes the final occupancy map.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Waypoint Proximity Check**: If the robot is within `0.5` meters of the current waypoint (`rho < 0.5`), it considers the waypoint as reached.
    - **Final Waypoint Handling**:
        - If the current waypoint is the last in the list (`self.index >= len(self.WP) - 1`), it prints a message indicating the final waypoint has been reached, stops the robot, and processes the occupancy map by calling `show_convolved_map()`.
    - **Advancing to Next Waypoint**:
        - Increments the waypoint index (`self.index += 1`) to target the next waypoint.
        - Prints the updated waypoint index and its coordinates for monitoring.
    - **Boundary Check**:
        - If the waypoint index exceeds the list length (`self.index >= len(self.WP)`), it confirms waypoint completion, stops the robot, and processes the occupancy map.
  
- **Functionality**: This method ensures that the robot progresses through the predefined waypoints sequentially and halts upon completing the final waypoint, triggering necessary post-navigation procedures.

### Stopping the Robot

```python
def stop_robot(self):
    """
    Stops the robot by setting both motor velocities to zero.
    """
    self.leftMotor.setVelocity(0)
    self.rightMotor.setVelocity(0)
```

- **Purpose**: Halts the robot's movement by setting both wheel motor velocities to zero.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Motor Velocity Control**: Applies a velocity of `0` to both the left and right motors, effectively stopping the robot.
  
- **Functionality**: Ensures that the robot ceases all movement when it has completed its trajectory or upon encountering specific conditions requiring a stop.

## Occupancy Mapping and Visualization

Occupancy mapping involves creating a grid-based representation of the environment, indicating the presence or absence of obstacles. The `TiagoController` class integrates LIDAR data to update the occupancy map and provides visualization capabilities for both the map and the robot's trajectory.

### Processing LIDAR Data

```python
def process_lidar(self, xw, yw, theta):
    """
    Processes Lidar data to update the occupancy map. It transforms Lidar points from the
    robot's frame to the world frame, updates the occupancy grid, and visualizes the points
    on the display.

    Args:
        xw (float): Current X position of the robot in the world frame.
        yw (float): Current Y position of the robot in the world frame.
        theta (float): Current orientation of the robot in radians.
    """
    # Check if the display device is initialized
    if self.display is None:
        print("Warning: Display device not initialized properly")
        return

    # Retrieve and preprocess Lidar range data
    ranges = np.array(self.lidar.getRangeImage())
    ranges[ranges == np.inf] = 100  # Replace infinite readings with a large value

    # Exclude the first and last 80 readings to avoid edge artifacts
    valid_ranges = ranges[80:-80]
    valid_angles = self.angles[80:-80]

    # Transform Lidar readings to the robot's coordinate system
    X_r = np.array([
        (valid_ranges * np.cos(valid_angles)),
        (valid_ranges * np.sin(valid_angles)),
        np.ones(len(valid_angles))
    ])

    # Transformation matrix from robot frame to world frame
    w_T_r = np.array([
        [np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta), xw],
        [np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta), yw],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    D = w_T_r @ X_r

    # Update the occupancy map based on transformed points
    for i in range(D.shape[1]):
        px, py = self.world2map(D[0, i], D[1, i])
        self.map[px, py] = min(self.map[px, py] + 0.01, 1.0)
        color_byte = int(self.map[px, py] * 255)
        color = (color_byte << 16) | (color_byte << 8) | color_byte
        self.display.setColor(color)
        self.display.drawPixel(px, py)
```

- **Purpose**: Converts raw LIDAR data into occupancy grid updates, mapping detected obstacles onto the environment grid.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Display Check**: Ensures that the display device is initialized before attempting to draw.
    - **LIDAR Data Retrieval**: Fetches the range data from the LIDAR sensor using `self.lidar.getRangeImage()`. Converts the data to a NumPy array for efficient processing.
    - **Infinite Values Handling**: Replaces any infinite readings (indicating no detection) with a large value (`100`) to standardize the data.
    - **Data Slicing**: Excludes the first and last 80 readings to eliminate edge artifacts or irrelevant data points.
    - **Coordinate Transformation**:
        - **Robot Frame**: Converts polar LIDAR data (ranges and angles) into Cartesian coordinates `(X_r, Y_r)` in the robot's frame.
        - **World Frame**: Applies a transformation matrix (`w_T_r`) based on the robot's current position and orientation to map these points into the world frame coordinates `(D)`.
    - **Occupancy Map Update**:
        - Iterates through each transformed LIDAR point.
        - Transforms world coordinates to map grid coordinates using `world2map()`.
        - Increments the occupancy value at the corresponding grid cell, capping it at `1.0` to denote maximum occupancy.
        - Converts the occupancy value to a grayscale color for visualization.
        - Draws the occupancy point on the display.
  
- **Functionality**: This method effectively maps the robot's immediate environment, allowing it to recognize obstacles and free spaces, which is essential for navigation and obstacle avoidance.

### Drawing the Trajectory

```python
def draw_trajectory(self, xw, yw):
    """
    Draws the robot's current position on the trajectory map and visualizes it in red on the display.

    Args:
        xw (float): Current X position of the robot in the world frame.
        yw (float): Current Y position of the robot in the world frame.
    """
    # Check if the display device is initialized
    if self.display is None:
        print("Warning: Display device not initialized properly")
        return

    # Convert world coordinates to map grid coordinates
    px, py = self.world2map(xw, yw)
    self.trajectory_map[px, py] = 1.0  # Mark the trajectory point
    self.display.setColor(0xFF0000)    # Set color to red for the trajectory
    for i in range(250):
        for j in range(300):
            if self.trajectory_map[i, j] > 0:
                self.display.drawPixel(i, j)
```

- **Purpose**: Visualizes the robot's path by marking its current position on the trajectory map and displaying it on the simulation's display device.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Display Check**: Ensures that the display device is initialized before attempting to draw.
    - **Coordinate Transformation**: Converts the robot's current world coordinates `(xw, yw)` to map grid coordinates `(px, py)` using `world2map()`.
    - **Trajectory Marking**: Updates the trajectory map by setting the corresponding grid cell to `1.0`, indicating the robot has traversed that point.
    - **Visualization**:
        - Sets the drawing color to red (`0xFF0000`) to differentiate the trajectory from the occupancy map.
        - Iterates through the entire trajectory map, drawing red pixels at positions where the trajectory has been marked.
  
- **Functionality**: This method provides a visual trail of the robot's movement, aiding in monitoring and debugging the navigation process.

### Convolving and Displaying the Map

```python
def show_convolved_map(self):
    """
    Processes the occupancy map using convolution with a predefined kernel to identify
    significant obstacles or features. It then displays the convolved map using matplotlib.
    """
    cmap = signal.convolve2d(self.map, self.kernel, mode='same')
    cspace = cmap > 0.9  # Thresholding to create a binary occupancy grid
    plt.imshow(cspace, cmap='gray')
    plt.title("Convolved Map")
    plt.show()
```

- **Purpose**: Enhances the occupancy map by applying convolution to identify significant obstacles and visualizes the processed map.
  
- **Operation**:
    - **Convolution**: Applies a 2D convolution operation between the occupancy map (`self.map`) and the kernel (`self.kernel`). The `mode='same'` parameter ensures the output map has the same dimensions as the input.
    - **Thresholding**: Creates a binary occupancy grid (`cspace`) by thresholding the convolved map, marking cells with values greater than `0.9` as occupied (`True`) and others as free (`False`).
    - **Visualization**:
        - Uses `matplotlib.pyplot` to display the convolved and thresholded occupancy map.
        - Sets the colormap to grayscale (`'gray'`) for clarity.
        - Adds a title "Convolved Map" for context.
        - Calls `plt.show()` to render the visualization.
  
- **Functionality**: This method provides a processed view of the environment, highlighting significant obstacles and features, which is essential for informed navigation and decision-making.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Initial Round Setup**:
    - **Arm Positioning**:
        - Calls `control_arm` with the `'arm-initial'` action ID and a set of joint positions to set the arm to its initial state.
        - If unsuccessful, raises a `RuntimeError` indicating failure to set the initial arm position.
    - **Initial Navigation**:
        - Calls `control_wheel` with the `'navigation-initial'` action ID and a list containing the first waypoint `(0.960, 0.500)`.
        - If unsuccessful, raises a `RuntimeError` indicating failure in initial navigation.
  
2. **Fine-Tune Waypoints**:
    - **`finetune_waypoints`**: Defines additional waypoints for rounds 1 to 3 to ensure objects from the kitchen are not in the same position. These waypoints provide more precise navigation paths during the mission.

3. **Executing Rounds 1-3**:
    - **Loop**: Iterates through `round_num` values from `1` to `3`, executing a sequence of actions in each round.
    - **Actions per Round**:
        1. **Grabbing an Object**:
            - Calls `grab_object` with the current `round_num`.
            - If unsuccessful, raises a `RuntimeError` indicating failure to grab the object in the current round.
        2. **Navigating to Drop Position**:
            - Calls `control_wheel` with a specific action ID (`'navigation-{round_num}a'`) and a list of waypoints to navigate towards the drop position.
            - If unsuccessful, raises a `RuntimeError` indicating failure in navigation.
        3. **Dropping the Object**:
            - Calls `drop_object` with the current `round_num`.
            - If unsuccessful, raises a `RuntimeError` indicating failure to drop the object in the current round.
        4. **Returning Along the Path**:
            - Calls `control_wheel` with a specific action ID (`'navigation-{round_num}b'`) and a list of waypoints to navigate back along the return path.
            - If unsuccessful, raises a `RuntimeError` indicating failure in return navigation.
  
4. **Mission Completion**:
    - After successfully completing all rounds, logs a debug message indicating the mission's successful completion and returns `True`.
  
5. **Error Handling**:
    - Catches any exceptions during the mission execution, logs a debug message with the error, stops the robot by setting motor velocities to zero, and returns `False` to indicate mission failure.

**Functionality**: This main control loop ensures that the robot performs its mission in a structured mannerâ€”initializing its arm and navigation, executing multiple rounds of object manipulation and navigation, and handling any errors that may arise during the mission.
